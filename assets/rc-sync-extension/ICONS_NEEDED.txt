ICONS REQUIRED FOR EXTENSION
================================

You need to create 3 icon files in this directory:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be square PNG images with transparent backgrounds.

ICON IDEAS:
- Ship anchor icon
- Cruise ship silhouette
- "RC" monogram
- Ship wheel
- Casino chip with ship

QUICK SOLUTION:
You can use any of the existing app icons from:
- assets/images/ folder
- Or find free icons at: https://www.flaticon.com/

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
The extension will still work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.

To add icons later:
1. Create the PNG files
2. Save them in this folder as icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
3. Reload the extension in chrome://extensions/
